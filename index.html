    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Rachel is an undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology studying for a B.S.A in Literature, Media, and Communication with a focus on filmmaking. Coming from a background of 12 years of fine arts training, she enjoys the opportunity that film has granted in rediscovering and continuing to nurture her art. Many of her film projects have involved stop motion animation and building miniature sets and models. She has been involved, helping lead the film club, organizing film festivals, and plans to continue to do so. She has also worked on short films with her peers both outside of school and in school, and has explored a range of roles such as: makeup artist, cinematographer, editor, and whatever else the project calls for, because she hates saying “no” to chances to grow.<br /><br />
      As a fan of international cinema, especially in East Asia, she intends to work abroad in the future to pursue a diverse production of media across borders.
